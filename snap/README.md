## What is NOT Working...but expected to be so

* Hook scripts that require external commands from the host won't be working due to security confinement, you may workaround it by disabling the security confinement or toggle the "Bypass Commit Hooks" switch in the "Actions..." menu in the commit widget.

## What is NOT Tested...yet

- send2trash
- grep
- Git Large File Storage
- Git Annex

And all the things not listed in the "What is Working" section
